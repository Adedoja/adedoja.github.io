  <h1>Hello World!!</h1>

  <p>Hi, I’m Aayatullah Adeyemi — a Computer Science senior at the University of North Florida focused on cybersecurity and software development.
   I build things, break things (ethically), and care about how systems fail. My work spans security labs, backend projects, databases, and automation, with a strong interest in defensive security, data, and applied AI.
   I am currently seeking entry-level roles or internships where I can turn technical curiosity into real-world impact.
    My interests outside of the classroom include activism, debates, and writing.
