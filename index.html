  <h1>Hello World!!</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my page. My name is Aayatullah Adeyemi, I am a senior at the University of North Florida.
    I am a computer science major and my interests include cybersecurity, software engineering, data analytics, and project management (In that order). 
    It is summer of 2025, and I hope I can update this when I land my first job. I was inspired to create this because I have a lot of ideas that I want to showcase.
    I hope to become a cloud security engineer, while also being a software engineer.
    <br><br>
    My interests outside of the classroom include activism, debates, and writing.
