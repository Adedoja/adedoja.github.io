<h1>Hello World!! </h1>
<p>Welcome to my page. My name is Aayatullah Adeyemi, I am a senior at the University of North Florida.
  I am a computer science major and my interests include cybersecurity, software engineering, data analytics and project management (In that order). 
  It is summer of 2025, and I hope I can update this when I land my first job. I was inspired to create this because I have a lot of ideas that I want to showcase. I hope to become a cloud security engineer, while also being a software engineer.
My interests outside of classroom includes activism, debates and writing.
